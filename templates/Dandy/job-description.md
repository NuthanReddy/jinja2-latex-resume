What You’ll Do
Build & Lead the Data Engineering Team: Define the vision for a team that sits at the intersection of engineering and analytics. You will hire, mentor, and define career paths for engineers who specialize in high-complexity modeling and transformation.

Architect the Semantic Layer: Move beyond simple replication. You will design domain-driven data models that crystallize business concepts into a trusted, centralized semantic layer.

Drive Technical Rigor & Performance: You will own the health of our data warehouse. This means optimizing SQL query performance, designing efficient table structures, and ensuring our pipelines are cost-effective and lightning-fast.

Proactive "Upstream" Engineering: Stop fixing broken data downstream. You will partner with Software Engineering teams before code is shipped to implement Data Contracts and ensure long-term data success is baked into the application design.

Accelerate Data Velocity: Your team will build the "paved road" for data access. You will create modular, reusable data components that allow Analysts and Data Scientists to answer new questions in hours, not weeks.

Treat Data as a Product: Implement rigorous SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for data availability and quality. You will ensure that the data products we build are monitored, tested, and reliable.

What We’re Looking For
Modeling & Architecture Expertise: You have deep experience in dimensional modeling (Kimball), data mart design, and complex SQL logic. You know how to translate messy real-world processes into clean, query-efficient structures.

Leadership Experience: 3+ years managing Data Engineers or Analytics Engineers. You know how to balance the technical growth of your team with the delivery of business value.

Technical Excellence (SQL & dbt): You are an expert in the modern data stack (dbt, Snowflake/BigQuery, Airflow/Dagster). You understand how to write code that is not only correct but highly performant at scale.

Collaborative Stakeholder Management: You can translate technical constraints to business stakeholders and advocate for data needs with software engineering leaders. You are comfortable negotiating data contracts and preventing technical debt.

Focus on Reliability: You are obsessed with testing. You implement robust CI/CD pipelines for data, ensuring that no bad code breaks the build and no bad data reaches the CEO’s dashboard.

Strategic Vision: You can see the big picture. You are building a data foundation that will support Dandy not just today, but through our next phase of hyper-growth.
