Octopus Energy - Staff
3+ yrs experience on dbt
One of the largest dbt projects I’ve worked on was at enterprise scale, where we built 30+ models. The project had 15+ contributors across data science, data engineering, and product teams. It was integrated with Databricks as the compute engine, leveraging Delta Lake for reliability and scalability.

- I was responsible for architecting the dbt project structure, enforcing modularity and clear lineage across layers. 
- I introduced naming conventions, testing frameworks (schema + data tests), and CI/CD pipelines to ensure every PR was validated before merging.
- I've tuned for Databricks SQL performance, including partitioning, clustering, and incremental strategies.
