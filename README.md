## jinja2-latex-resume

> Generate professional, highly customizable resumes with Python, Jinja2 templating, LaTeX, and automatic PDF export. Effortlessly create data-driven, beautiful CVs with modern, automated workflows.

**In simple terms:** \
➡️ You upload a json (relatively easy structure to latex) with your professional details \
➡️ This project uses the existing template .tex (latex file converted to jinja2 template) \
➡️ Renders a .tex file with your details \
➡️ Compiles to a beautiful PDF resume.

> ⚠️ Still working on it. ⚠️

### Coming up soon:

- a sample resume json file containing structured data
- more templates 🥳
- better documentation 
- tested report for windows devices (currently only tested on linux - windows setup code is LLM generated but untested)
