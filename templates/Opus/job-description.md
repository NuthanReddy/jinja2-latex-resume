⭐ Why this role
Shape a cloud‑native data architecture on AWS that underpins analytics, ML, and product.
Set the standards for Databricks usage, PySpark conventions, and data modeling across domains.
Work with engaged stakeholders (Product, Engineering, Data Science, Clinical Ops) who value pragmatic, outcome‑driven design.
Real influence: blueprint today’s platform and the roadmap for the next phase of scale.
🔧 What you’ll own
Target Architecture & Roadmap: Define current → target state for data platforms, services, and integrations.
Modeling & Standards: Establish dimensional/data‑vault/medallion patterns, coding standards, and reusable templates for Databricks + PySpark.
Governance by Design: Implement data quality, lineage, cataloguing, and access controls; partner on privacy & compliance in a regulated domain.
Platform Guidance (AWS): Leverage S3, Glue, Lambda, EMR/Databricks, Redshift (or equivalent) to deliver scalable, cost‑efficient data services.
Enablement: Coach Data Engineering and Analytics teams; drive architectural reviews, reference architectures, and design playbooks.
Performance & Cost: Introduce observability, right‑sizing and workload orchestration to keep pipelines fast and spend under control.


🎯 What we’re looking for
Proven experience as a Data Architect (or Senior stepping up), ideally in data‑intensive or regulated environments.
Strong hands‑on understanding of Databricks and PySpark (you set the patterns; you don’t have to code daily).
Solid AWS data stack exposure (S3, Glue, Lake/Lakehouse, Redshift or similar) and modern ELT/ETL approaches.
Practical data modelling skills (star/snowflake, data vault, medallion) and governance (catalogue, lineage, RBAC).
Comfortable partnering with senior stakeholders; clear, business‑first communication.
Life Sciences experience is a bonus—not a blocker. Curiosity and product thinking matter more.
